# CorAidApp

Title: Cor-Aid App

Description:-

This app is for people living in slums or for migrant workers who are stranded on their way home. 
They need help from NGOs. Our app collaborates with NGOs and gives them the exact location of the person and what help they need. 
It also gives the person extra incentive to stay wherever they are and follow the rules because the NGO keeps track of their location. 
Essential supplementary information is also provided like news around them and a helpline.

The User Interface of the App was intially designed on Adobe xD and then the app was constructed on Android Studio, using Java and XML.
